# Dev Server Management

## Running Server

- **NEVER** restart `npm run dev` if it's already running
- **ALWAYS** check terminals folder first to see if dev server is active
- Use the existing running dev server for all development work

## Before Starting Server

1. List terminals folder to check for running processes
2. Look for `npm run dev` or `vite` in terminal output
3. Only start server if no dev server is currently running

## Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

- Vite has HMR enabled by default
- File changes are automatically reflected in the browser
- No server restart needed for code changes
